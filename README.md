"I have developed a robust frontend application in React that seamlessly manages chat messages and user connectivity. The frontend interacts with a highly optimized backend server written in JavaScript, utilizing the Socket.IO module to ensure smooth and efficient data transfer between the client and server. This technological stack not only enhances the overall user experience but also provides a scalable solution for managing a large number of users and chat interactions."
